Installation

The BioSeq-Analysis package can be run on Linux (64-bit) and Windows (64-bit) operating system. The full package and documents of BioSeq-Analysis are available at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/BioSeq-Analysis/download. Before using BioSeq-Analysis, the Python software should be first installed and configured. Python 2.7 64-bit is recommended, which can be downloaded from https://www.python.org. 
After Python installed, the Python package Numpy [4] should be downloaded and installed from here: http://www.numpy.org/, or use the following command if Internet is accessible:
> pip install numpy

After numpy installed, the Python package SciPy [5] should be downloaded and installed from here: https://www.scipy.org/install.html and the Python package scikit-learn [6] should be downloaded and installed from here: http://scikit-learn.org/dev/install.html, or use the following commands if Internet is accessible:
> pip install scipy
> pip install scikit-learn

For Windows operating system, the Windows 7 or later versions are supported. The next step is the installation and configuration of LIBSVM [7]. Extract the package to a directory. After un-zip the downloaded BioSeq-Analysis package, make sure that the ¡°libsvm.dll¡± is available in the directory ¡°¡­\libsvm\windows¡±

For Linux operating system, the LIBSVM should be configured firstly. Un-zip the Pse-Analysis package to a folder, for example, ¡°~/usr¡±. Navigate to ¡°~/usr/BioSeq-Analysis/libsvm¡± directory, and type the command:
> make
After executing successfully, then navigate to ¡°~/usr/BioSeq-Analysis/libsvm/python¡± directory, and type the command:
> make
If gnuplot has not been installed, use the following command lines to install gnuplot:
> sudo apt-get install gnuplot
